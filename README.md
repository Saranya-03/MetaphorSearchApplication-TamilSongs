# MetaphorSearchApplication-TamilSongs
Here I proposed a search application for metaphors in Tamil songs. Initially, I have planned to build a text corpus of metaphors which contains more than 100 unique and best Tamil songs of A.R.Rahman, Anirudh, Ilaiyaraya and Yuvan Shankar Raja from 2000 to 2022. And each song should have at least a metaphor. And for each metaphor, I have planned to include following attributes:
1.	Title – Title of the song
2.	Lyrics – Full lyrics of the song in Tamil
3.	Lyricist – A person who writes the lyrics of the song.
4.	Singer – A person who sings the song
5.	Composer – A person who writes the music of the song
6.	Album – Movie name / Album name where the song includes.
7.	Year – Released year of the song
8.	Metaphor (All metaphors in the song)
a.	Type of Metaphor
b.	Source domain
c.	Target domain
d.	Interpretation

As we already know, A metaphor is a figure of speech which describes an object or action in a way that is not literally true but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. It’s mainly used in songs to add some flavor to the song which may be difficult to understand for some users. So, for getting the meaning of the metaphors in Tamil songs, I proposed this search application.  

Scope of the project:
1. Provide the meaning of the metaphors from any Tamil song for users who wants to know the meaning of the lyrics.
2. Search can be based on type of metaphor or source domain the metaphor or target domain of the metaphor.
